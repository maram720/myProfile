  	      <h2>My hobbies</h2>
  	      <p>
  		  My favorite activity during my leisure time is writing short stories. I love to write about fantasy and magicals worlds, friendship and love and sometimes about my own thoughts and stories. I do also play video games from time to time.

  	      <h2>My passions</h2>
  	      <p>
  	  	  	In a single word : "Space". I've always loved space and anything related to it since I was a kid. I'd watch hours of documentries about space and I have found it fascinating to learn about galaxies, different stars and blackholes. Each time I learn something new but I know that there's still much more to learn and I hope to be able to use what I'm learning in computer science to work in this field.

  	 	  <h2>My projects</h2>
          <p>
      		I'm working on some small projects related to what I'm learning in Uni. It's an opportunity for me to improve the skills and knowledge I'm acquiring and also learn new things.
